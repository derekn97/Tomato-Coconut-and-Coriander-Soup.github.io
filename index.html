      <h1>Tomato, Coconut, and Coriander Soup</h1>
	  <sub>
	  <p><em>Serves 6</em></p>
	  </sub>
	  <p>The fresh acidity of tomatoes adores the smooth silkiness of coconut milk, and for an extra Asian flavour I add lots of chopped fresh coriander. Tinned tomatoes and coconut milk are two of my must-have store-cupboard ingredients. This is a super-speedy soup to make, and happily, it can also be frozen.</p>

			   <h4>For the Soup</h4>
                  <ul>
				   <li>250ml vegetable or chicken stock</li>
				   <li>1 tablespoon coconut oil</li>
				   <li>2 tablespoons chopped coriander (the leaves and the tender stalks at the top)</li>
				   <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
				   <li>salt, freshly ground pepper and sugar</li>
				   <li>2 × 400g tins of plum tomatoes,  chopped, or 800g fresh tomatoes, peeled (see note) and chopped</li>
				   <li>1 x 400ml tin of coconut milk</li>

			    <h4>For the Garnish</h4>
			     <ul>
			      <li>1-2 tablespoons crème fraîche</li>
				  <li>a few coriander leaves</li>

            <div class=”main”>
               <p>Place a saucepan on a medium heat and add the coconut oil. Allow to melt, then tip in the chopped onion and season with salt and pepper. Turn the heat down to low, then cover the onions with a butter wrapper or a piece of parchment paper and a lid, and cook gently, stirring from time to time, for 10 minutes, until soft but not coloured.

			   Add the tomatoes (plus any juice), the coconut milk and the vegetable or chicken stock, and season with salt, pepper and a few pinches of sugar. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes, until the tomatoes are tasting mellow and cooked. 
			   <br/>
		       <br/>
			   Add the chopped coriander and blend well. Season to taste and serve immediately, or reheat when needed.

			   To serve, spoon a few small blobs of crème fraîche on to each bowl of hot soup and finish with a few coriander leaves.</p>

	  <p><strong><em>Note:</strong></em> To peel fresh tomatoes, cut an X through the skin, then put them into a bowl. Cover them with boiling water and leave them for 10-15 seconds, until the skins are loose and will peel off easily.</p>
